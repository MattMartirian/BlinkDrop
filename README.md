# BlinkDrop ðŸš€ðŸ’¾

(BlinkDrop is still hunder heavy development.)

**BlinkDrop** is your go-to tool for quick and hassle-free file sharing between friends. No need for cloud services, no logins, no limits. Just fast, simple file transfers directly from one computer to another, like teleporting your files through the digital void in a _blink_ of an eye.

Whether you're sharing videos, game mods, codes, or that funny meme you just downloaded, BlinkDrop gets it done in a blink! âš¡

## Why BlinkDrop?
- **Instant Transfers**: Send and receive files as if you were handing them over in person.
- **No Third-Party Platforms**: Your files go directly from your computer to your friend'sâ€”no cloud services or slow uploads.
- **Smart File Handling**: Already have that file? BlinkDrop automatically checks and skips downloading duplicates (unless you want to update!). (WIP)
- **Just Works**: No accounts, no confusing menus. Open it up, choose your files, and share away.

## How It Works
1. The **Server** (the person sharing the files) gets their local IP from BlinkDrop.
2. The **Client** pastes that IP in their BlinkDrop app.
3. The **Server** starts the connection, and BlinkDrop opens the stream.
4. The **Client** connects and automatically begins downloading the shared files.

No matter if youâ€™re in the next room or miles apart, BlinkDrop transforms file sharing into a breeze. Perfect for when you just need to get that file to your friend *right now*â€”no middleman, just a quick exchange.
